### 1. Answer Surveys For Money

<img title="Survey" alt="Survey" src="https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/business-survey-research-concept_53876-121246.jpg?t=st=1729528113~exp=1729531713~hmac=1f7b1c2694dfc91b72188f9131fa8c066747c343d3832141f4599929cd57fe6c&w=996">

One of the easiest methods to earn $20 a day is by using get-paid-to (GPT) websites.

These platforms reward you for doing small tasks, such as taking surveys, shopping online, playing games, or even watching ads. While you won’t become wealthy with these sites, they are a reliable way to quickly earn $20 a day in extra cash.

If you own a bike, car, or scooter, food delivery gigs offer a simple way to earn extra income.

These delivery apps can pay you around $20 within just an hour or two of work. Most platforms allow you to sign up if you’re at least 18 years old and have access to a vehicle, whether it’s a bike, car, or scooter. Some of the leading gig jobs in this field include:

* **Grubhub**

* **Uber Eats**

* **DoorDash**

* **Instacart**



### 3. Play Games For Cash

Making money playing video games might sound too good to be true. But these days, there are numerous apps that pay you to play games that you can use to earn quick money and gift cards in your spare time.

Some leading gaming rewards apps you can use to start earning include:

* [Mistplay](https://mistplay.com): The leading mobile gaming rewards app for Android that lets you earn free gift cards for gaming.

### 4. Cryptocurrency
<img title="Crypto" alt="Crypto" src="https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/bitcoin-coin-closeup-circuit-board-finance-concept_169016-61404.jpg?t=st=1729522832~exp=1729526432~hmac=c0d8ddb24da8433425d3d33f586ead2a6925d4e78c8943b9291c13cf77940fc1&w=1060">

Let’s be honest—cryptocurrency trading can sound a bit intimidating, and it’s not exactly the easiest way to make $20 a day. It definitely requires some capital, a bit of research, and patience to actually turn a profit. But, if you’re willing to dive in and learn the ropes, crypto can become a solid side hustle with huge earning potential!

**Here are some ways you can make money with crypto:**

[Airdrops](https://accounts.binance.com/register?ref=13732272): Ever heard of getting free money? Well, with airdrops, you can. Companies launching new tokens often give away free crypto to build excitement around their projects. All you usually need to do is follow simple instructions like signing up for a wallet or promoting them on social media. It’s a low-effort way to score free coins that might end up being worth something in the future. My advice? Don’t sleep on these—you never know what could blow up!

**[Buying Smaller Coins:](https://accounts.binance.com/register?ref=13732272)** We’ve all heard the success stories of people who bought Bitcoin or Ethereum before they skyrocketed. The same could happen with smaller, lesser-known coins. The trick is to do your homework. Look into new projects, check out their teams, and see if they have potential. I won’t lie—this is risky. But, if you play it smart and don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose, you could get in early on the next big thing.

**[Holding Stablecoins::](https://accounts.binance.com/register?ref=13732272)** For those who want a little less risk, holding popular coins like Bitcoin or Ethereum can be a more stable option. Sure, the prices fluctuate, but they’re generally safer than jumping into unknown altcoins. If you're in it for the long haul, this can be a good strategy. My tip here: be patient. Crypto is a game of ups and downs, so holding through those low points is key.

Now, let’s talk about some perks you can get from crypto exchanges, because who doesn’t love extra rewards, right?

[Trading rewards](https://accounts.binance.com/register?ref=13732272): Some exchanges actually reward you for trading. That’s right—hit certain milestones like a specific trading volume, and you might get bonus tokens or coins. It’s like earning rewards points at your favorite store, but here it could turn into real money.

**[Staking:](https://accounts.binance.com/register?ref=13732272)** A cool option that’s becoming super popular is staking. Instead of letting your coins sit there, you can lock them up on certain platforms and earn interest or more crypto. It’s a pretty passive way to make some money on what you already own. The longer you stake, the more you can earn. Just be sure to understand the lock-up periods—you might not be able to access your funds for a while.

**[Fee discounts:](https://accounts.binance.com/register?ref=13732272)** If you’re trading regularly, those transaction fees can add up. Many exchanges offer discounts if you hold their native tokens. This means lower fees and potentially higher profits. I definitely recommend checking if your platform has this option—it’s a nice little hack to save money while trading.

**Thoughts & Tips**

Look, crypto trading isn’t for everyone. It takes time, effort, and a little bit of risk tolerance. But if you’re interested in learning and not afraid of the volatility, it could be a fantastic way to grow your income. Just remember to start small, don’t invest more than you can afford to lose, and always do your research before diving in.

If you’re still on the fence, I suggest trying out some airdrops or staking a small amount to test the waters. These are low-commitment ways to see how the crypto world works without taking on too much risk.

And most importantly—stay patient and keep learning. The crypto market changes fast, so keeping up with trends can be the difference between a solid return and a missed opportunity!

### 5. Create Passive Income Streams

If you’re looking to make $20 a day in passive income, there are plenty of opportunities to achieve this goal.

**Here are a few passive income ideas you can explore to start earning:**

* Investing in income-generating real estate through companies

* Renting out assets like a spare room on Airbnb or storage space via Neighbor

* Investing in dividend-paying stocks and ETFs

* Selling stock photos or music to earn royalties

* Using passive income apps to generate money with your smartphone

* Selling your internet bandwidth for passive income

These are just some of the many beginner-friendly options available. By combining a few of these methods, you can create steady income streams that eventually generate $20 a day in passive earnings.

### 6. Sell Stuff You Own

<img title="Selling-stuff" alt="selling-stuff" src="https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/hand-drawn-flea-market-concept-illustrated_23-2148820743.jpg?t=st=1729527953~exp=1729531553~hmac=6a8d80e7d562f45376ce0cd112710717c26c364e201ead8d1049d07da6345a0c&w=900">

Selling stuff is always a reliable option to make some side cash. Some people also take this pretty seriously and flip money through retail arbitrage, which involves constantly buying and reselling merchandise for a profit.

But it doesn’t matter if you’re just doing some Spring cleaning or want to start a flipping business; there are so many ways you can sell stuff for cash.

**Some of my favorite selling apps and marketplaces include:**

* **Facebook Marketplace:** A great way to sell almost anything for cash to people in your area.

* **Mercari:** An easy-to-use selling app that lets you sell in person and online.

* **OfferUp:** Another local or online selling Facebook Marketplace alternative that lets you sell anything from clothing to old sports gear.

* **Poshmark:** One of the best marketplaces for selling designer clothing, accessories, and shoes.

* **Worthy:** My favorite place to sell watches, jewelry, and diamonds online for cash.

Categories like apparel, electronics, and home goods typically sell fast, but you’d be amazed at the type of stuff you can sell.

For example, people make money all the time by selling rare collectibles like Pokemon cards, or even random things like used bikes. In the past, I’ve made money selling instruments, clothing, and used furniture when I was in college. 

**Tip** Some people buy things in bulk, like pokemon cards to later on sell them individually to make a profit!

### 7. Try User Testing Gigs

User testing gigs pay you for testing new websites and apps that are in development and giving your feedback.

In other words, you’re basically doing quality assurance work and sharing your opinion to help companies make better apps and websites for their customers. And if you want to make $20 a day online, website testing gigs are the perfect place to start.

For example, companies like UserTesting pay you anywhere from $4 to $120 per testing session, with most short tests paying $10 to $15.

**Some of the best websites like UserTesting you can use include:**

* [UserTesting](https://www.usertesting.com)

* [Test IO](https://test.io)


You have to accept testing gigs quickly since there’s lots of competition with other testers. But if you land a test or two per day, this is a very simple way to earn $20 per day online.

### 8. Use Mystery Shopping Apps

If someone told you it’s possible to get paid for shopping, you might be pretty skeptical. However, this is exactly what mystery shopping gigs pay you to do.

Generally, these apps involve completing tasks like walking into stores, taking photos of products, or confirming the price of things. In exchange, you get paid with cash or gift cards for your efforts.

Premise and Shopkick are two popular mystery shopping apps you can try. Other phone-based jobs like Gigwalk and Field Agent also pay you for completing short local gigs, and you get paid through PayPal as well.

### 9. Get $20 In Free Sign-Up Bonuses

While this is only a temporary idea, you can always leverage sign-up offers to score some free money. After all, plenty of companies are willing to pay new users for trying out their platforms.

Some lucrative sign-up offers you can leverage include:

* [Rakuten](https://www.rakuten.com): Get $30 for free when you sign up!

* [Swagbucks](https://premium.gg2u.org?referrer=coinbai): A leading rewards platform with a $10 sign up bonus and plenty of ways to earn.

* **Current:** This digital banking solution pays 4% APY and also has a $50 sign up bonus.

* **Fetch Rewards:** Use a Fetch Rewards referral code and get 3,000 points ($3) for free!

* **Drop:** Use our Drop invite code and get up to $15 worth of free Drop points.

### 10. Make Money Blogging

Speaking of passive income, another idea you can try is to make money with a blog. And I know this idea works since I’ve accomplished it with two different blogs at this point.

This just goes to show the power of blogging and what the income potential is like!

### 11. Make Money On YouTube

If you’re feeling creative, another idea to make $20 a day online is to make money on YouTube.

I also know this is possible because my YouTube channel now makes $100 a day like clockwork, all from Google AdSense ads:

Like blogging, YouTube has a learning curve. Plus, you also need 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time to turn on ads to start making money. But once a YouTube video ranks well, it can turn into a reliable source of passive income for years to come.

And I also like YouTube because you don’t need a lot of money to get started, a simple smartphone and a camera-stand can be enough for starting out.

And of course, a single viral video can change your channel and life, so I think this idea to get $20 a day has some of the highest potential out there.

### 12. Start A Pet Sitting Business

People are willing to pay for dog walkers or pet sitters, and if you earn $15 to $25 per hour, a single hour or two with a client’s pets makes you $20.

And the great news is that you don’t need to find clients by yourself or canvas your entire neighborhood. Companies like Rover connect dog walkers and sitters with people in their neighborhood who need help.

So, with a handful of clients, you might have a steady pet sitting and walking business on your hand, earning $20 per day or much more depending on how often you work.

You can read our post on the best Rover headlines if you want to give Rover a try. Alternatively, you can use websites like TaskRabbit to offer pet sitting services or other odd jobs for cash.

### 13. Deliver Packages For Money

Like **DoorDash** and **Instacart**, you can always deliver packages for money. And the great news is that there’s plenty of apps and companies that you can sign up for to get started with this hustle.

**Amazon Flex** is a prime example. It lets you earn $18 to $25 per hour for delivering packages to Amazon customers. This means a single delivery shift could mean $20 in your pocket in just an hour!

You have to claim Amazon Flex blocks in advance, so it’s not the most flexible side hustle unlike DoorDash. But the hourly rate is one of the highest in the gig economy.

Similar gig apps like Roadie, Walmart Spark, and GoShare also pay you for delivering packages, and both can make 20 dollars in an hour two.

You have to factor gas and depreciation into your earnings for these driving gigs. But they’re a reliable, solid side hustle to test out.

### 14. Make Money With Freelancing

One final idea to make 20 dollars a day online is to sell your skills as a freelancer.

Freelance writing is just one path you can take. Other popular freelancing industries and jobs include:

> **Accounting**
>
> **Business development**
>
> **Digital marketing**
>
> **Graphic design**
>
> **Paid advertising**
>
> **SEO**
>
> **Social media management**
>
> **Web design**
>
> **Video editing**
>
> **Virtual assistant**

You can find beginner jobs on Upwork or Fiverr to start building your portfolio.

Making $20 a day might feel out of reach depending on where you’re starting, but every big goal begins with small steps!

Here are some helpful tips to keep in mind as you work towards hitting this income target:

    Try Different Ideas: Experimenting with various side hustles is the best way to figure out what works for you. Whether it’s delivering for Uber Eats, starting a blog, or using platforms like Survey Junkie, pick a few ideas that interest you and give them a shot!
    Play to Your Strengths: If you’re a strong writer, freelance writing could be an easier path to earning $20 a day than becoming a virtual assistant. Focus on what you’re good at to get an edge on the competition.
    Set a Timeframe: Goals are most effective when they’re specific. After choosing your side hustles, set a timeframe for when you want to hit your income goal.

I hope this guide helps you take a step closer to earning $20 a day and reaching your financial milestones.

There are plenty of side hustle opportunities out there, so stay patient, stay motivated, and remember: saving more through budgeting and smart spending is just as valuable as earning more!
