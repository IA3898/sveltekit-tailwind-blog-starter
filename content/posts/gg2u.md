#### **1. Golden Spin**
One of the most exciting features on [GG2U](https://premium.gg2u.org?referrer=coinbai) is the **Golden Spin**. After completing offers and surveys, you accumulate progress toward a spin on the Golden Wheel, which can reward you with additional coins (minumum 1$). The more spins you earn, the more chances you have to win extra money. It's a nice bonus that keeps users engaged, and it's possible to land some decent rewards.

#### **2. Surveys**
As with most beermoney sites, surveys are a significant part of [GG2U](https://premium.gg2u.org?referrer=coinbai). The surveys come from different providers, and the pay per survey varies, but it's not uncommon to earn between $1 and $3 per survey. Survey availability can differ depending on your demographic, but GG2U seems to have a good flow of options to keep users busy.

#### **3. Watching Videos**
Watching videos is another option to earn on GG2U. It's a passive way to make some extra coins, but the pay is on the lower side. Expect to earn a few cents per video, making it a task that is better suited for background activity while you do other things.

#### **4. Game Offers**
If you enjoy gaming, GG2U partners with game developers to offer rewards for trying out new games or reaching specific in-game achievements. It’s a fun way to earn, though be aware that some offers require purchases to get the higher rewards.

The average user on [GG2U](https://premium.gg2u.org?referrer=coinbai) can realistically expect to make between **$30 to $50 per month**, depending on how active they are. For casual users, it's easy to hit the minimum payout in about a week or two, but more consistent effort can boost your earnings. The addition of the Golden Spin feature adds a nice touch of luck, where you might earn even more with a bit of extra effort. It's definitely one of those sites that you want in your GPT-stack to have a nice little monthly income combined with other sites and applications.
