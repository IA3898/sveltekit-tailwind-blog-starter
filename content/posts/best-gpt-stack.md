#### 3. **UserTesting - Get Paid for Your Opinion**

If testing websites or apps for usability sounds interesting, **UserTesting** is where you should be. It offers a higher payout than traditional GPT sites but requires a bit more involvement. You'll need to test websites, provide feedback on the design and functionality, and be willing to speak your thoughts out loud. While the pay is good it's much harder to come accros testing tasks and it's better combine it with other more relible GPT-sites if you want a steady income.

- **Average Earnings**: $60 per month
- **Max Earnings**: Up to $200
