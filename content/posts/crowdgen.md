Appen, a global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and data solutions, has recently launched its new platform, **Crowdgen**, replacing the well-known Appen Connect. Officially launched on September 14, 2024, Crowdgen aims to enhance the experience for freelancers and contributors by offering a more streamlined interface and improved functionality.

For those familiar with Appen Connect, the transition raises questions like: Why did Appen replace Connect with Crowdgen? How does this new platform work, and what changes should freelancers expect? In this review, I’ll share my personal experience with Crowdgen and compare it to the previous platform, Appen Connect.

## Crowdgen Appen: An Overview

Crowdgen is designed to be a contributor platform that provides AI-related tasks for freelancers. Freelancers and crowd workers from over 170 countries can log into the new platform using their Appen Connect credentials. For new users, signing up on the Crowdgen website is straightforward, and contributors can quickly create their profiles to start working on AI tasks.

Appen’s decision to replace Connect with Crowdgen reflects their effort to scale operations and improve the contributor experience. As a leading AI company with over 25 years of experience, Appen continues to push the boundaries of AI development and data collection, while keeping a global workforce of more than 1 million contributors actively engaged in projects.

## Crowdgen Jobs

One of the standout features of the new Crowdgen platform is the variety of AI-related tasks now available. Unlike Appen Connect, which limited job availability based on language and demographic factors, Crowdgen offers a broader range of opportunities based on the contributor's skills, certifications, and qualifications.

The dashboard now displays active and available projects, with visual representations of project goals through infographics. This feature makes it easier for freelancers to understand what the project entails before committing to it.

Tasks on Crowdgen often focus on AI technologies, with many jobs centered around social media evaluation, transcription, and audio recording. Given the rapid growth of social media and the need for better language processing, these jobs are more prevalent on the platform.

While data collection tasks were a significant part of Appen Connect, they seem less visible on the Crowdgen platform. However, users can update their profiles, certifications, and skills to unlock more job opportunities.

## Crowdgen Payment

One of the biggest improvements Crowdgen brings is its payment system. Previously, freelancers using Appen Connect had limited payout options, often facing fees from payment platforms like PayPal and Payoneer. Crowdgen, however, introduces five different payout methods, giving freelancers more flexibility in how they receive their earnings.

To set up payments, contributors need to:
1. Confirm their email and address details.
2. Verify their mobile number.
3. Fill out their tax details.
4. Choose their default payout method from the available options.

I recommend using a local bank transfer, as this will help avoid the annual $30 fee often charged by third-party payment platforms like PayPal and Payoneer. This step is a significant improvement that reduces unnecessary fees and streamlines the payment process.

## Crowdgen Work

One of the most attractive features of Crowdgen is its flexibility in work hours. Contributors can set their own schedules based on their availability and project deadlines. This feature allows workers to balance their freelancing efforts with other commitments, making Crowdgen an excellent platform for those who need to work part-time or on a flexible schedule.

Each project offers three work-hour options, helping freelancers manage their time and track progress effectively. Contributors can take on projects that fit their lifestyle and availability, ensuring they meet deadlines while enjoying the freedom to work from anywhere.

## My Honest Review

After testing the platform and exploring its new features, I found Crowdgen to be a significant upgrade over Appen Connect in many areas. The new interface (alltough many bugs during the initial release) is clean and easy to navigate, and I appreciated the added clarity provided by project infographics.

However, I did encounter some issues with previously applied projects. Some of the tasks I was waiting to be screened for seem to have disappeared in the transition to Crowdgen. This is disappointing, especially for contributors who had already invested time and effort in passing qualification tests.

Despite these setbacks, the improvements to payment methods, the flexibility of work hours, and the expanded job options make Crowdgen a solid platform for freelancers. The interface is user-friendly, and I particularly enjoyed the ability to update my skills and qualifications to receive more job invitations. This dynamic approach to task allocation helps contributors stay engaged and continue developing their skills.

Based on my experience, I would rate Crowdgen 4 out of 5 stars. There is room for improvement, but it is a positive step forward for Appen’s contributor network.

⭐⭐⭐⭐  
Rating: 4 out of 5.

## Final Thoughts: Is Crowdgen Good or Bad?

Overall, the launch of Crowdgen marks a necessary evolution in Appen’s platform. Change is inevitable, and in this case, it’s for the better. Crowdgen addresses several pain points of Appen Connect by offering more payment options, improving job variety, and providing more control over work schedules.

For freelancers looking for flexible, AI-related jobs, Crowdgen is an excellent platform that accommodates a wide range of skill levels and work preferences. While there are still some areas that need refinement—such as the loss of previously applied projects—Crowdgen stands out as a valuable tool for contributors around the world.

In an era where AI is rapidly evolving, Crowdgen provides a solid foundation for freelancers to gain experience and earn money from home. If you’re considering diving into the world of AI tasks, Crowdgen offers a fantastic opportunity to learn new skills and make money in the process.
