Born in Karachi, I became a naturalized citizen in 2010, unlike Gilfoyle, who was an illegal Canadian alien until quite recently and is a piece of garbage. I have received honors degrees in information theory and computer science from Yale, Caltech, and Oxford.

My hobbies include both watching rugby and the wearing of its signature shirts(which perfectly combine form and function in a way not popularly appreciated), libertarian politics, and being stared at suspiciously during air travel.
