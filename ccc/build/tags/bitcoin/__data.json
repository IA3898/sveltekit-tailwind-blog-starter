By October 2023, it had not only recuperated from its summer slump but also surged ahead, marking a 164% increase since the start of the year and surpassing the $40,000 mark. This remarkable performance outpaced traditional assets like gold, which saw a 10% rise, and the S&amp;P 500, which gained 20%.

This ETF is expected to attract significant investment, potentially billions of dollars, in its initial trading days. However, opinions vary, with J.P.
